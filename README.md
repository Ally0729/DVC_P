DVC-P: Deep Video Compression with Perceptual Optimizations [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10849)]
Our work is based on OpenDVC (Please refer to [OpenDVC](https://github.com/RenYang-home/OpenDVC) and [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15862)) but improves it with perceptual optimizations.
